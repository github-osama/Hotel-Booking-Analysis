# Hotel-Booking-Analysis

Our given dataset is a hotel booking data set. I analyzed a hotel booking dataset and discovered important factors related to hotel bookings. Firstly, I read the dataset in my collab notebook and gained an understanding of its variables. Next, I performed data cleaning and wrangling by using functions like drop(), fillna(), isna()/isnull(). I also added necessary columns for analysis and removed unnecessary ones.

**Introduction**
To explore the variables, I utilized visualization charts such as pie charts, count plots, bar plots, and heatmaps. These visualizations provided insights into the significant factors. Based on these findings, I can suggest relevant business objectives to clients.
